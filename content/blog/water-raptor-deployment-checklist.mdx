This is the speed-and-sanity checklist. The goal is simple: **make day one productive** and keep costs predictable by removing avoidable bottlenecks (access, staging, disposal, and unclear goals).

If you only do one thing after reading this: get us clear photos + a pinned map link + your “win condition.” Everything else gets easier from there.

## What to send us (so we can quote fast)

| Send this | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| 3–8 photos from shoreline level | Helps us see access, vegetation density, and staging constraints |
| A pinned map link (Google/Apple) | Shows access points, turns, and where support can stage |
| Your “win condition” | Keeps scope disciplined: open lanes, remove mats, restore depth, stabilize shoreline |
| Any constraints | Work windows, HOA visibility requirements, traffic, utilities, no-go zones |

If you want the fastest scoping call, include one line on what **stops you from using the water today** (access blocked, weeds, soft muck, turbidity, algae risk, shoreline failure).

## On-site access (the biggest hidden schedule driver)

Access makes or breaks production. A great machine can’t overcome a shoreline that can’t support staging or trucks.

### Checklist

- Confirm gate codes, lock combos, and where we can park/support.
- Confirm trailer turn-around space and any narrow turns.
- Identify soft shoreline areas (we’ll plan track entry and staging).
- Mark utilities/structures on the map (irrigation intakes, aerators, docks, lines).
- Note zones that must stay visually clean (parks, HOAs, public access).
- Confirm where material can be staged without blocking the machine’s feed line.

> Tip: If access is the constraint, send a photo of the best hard surface within ~200 feet of the shoreline. That’s often where we build a clean staging rhythm.

## What’s in the water (and what changes the plan)

You don’t need to identify every plant perfectly. Photos usually do the job. But these notes speed up planning:

- Dominant plants (cattails, phragmites, milfoil, pondweed, floating mats).
- Water level swings (stormwater basins behave differently than recreational lakes).
- Debris sources (storm drains, downed trees, leaf loading, public dumping).
- Algae presence (surface scum vs filamentous mats vs submerged growth).
- What changed recently: “after storms,” “after irrigation season,” “after last year’s dredge.”

If algae is a concern, use the site baseline page: [water quality testing](/resources/water-quality-testing). For bloom safety context: https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/hab/

## Material handling: decide the “where does it go” question early

Most projects slow down when disposal is vague. Decide early:

- **Staging:** Where can piles sit without blocking access?
- **Dewatering:** Do we have a pad/zone that can drain and stay firm?
- **Hauling:** Are trucks allowed on-site? Any route restrictions?
- **Destination:** On-site beneficial use, permitted stockpile, composting partner, landfill, etc.

If the work includes muck/sediment, start here before you lock schedule: [sediment removal plans](/resources/sediment-removal-plans).

## The one-page deployment plan (the order matters)

Most sites move faster when we follow a clean sequence.

1. **Open visibility and lanes** with [harvesting](/harvesting) so the shoreline is visible and staging stays usable.
2. **Remove the problem mass** (weed mats, debris, floating biomass) and keep it moving to shore.
3. **If depth is the driver**, measure soft-layer thickness and plan dewatering/hauling before the dredge window.
4. **Stabilize and maintain** with [lake management](/lake-management) so the site doesn’t drift back.

## A “walk-it-today” checklist (15–20 minutes)

Print this section or use it as a note template.

- [ ] Walk the shoreline and mark 2–3 access points on a map screenshot.
- [ ] Identify one clean staging zone where trucks can load without blocking traffic.
- [ ] Take photos of: worst vegetation, inlet corner, shallow shelf, and best access.
- [ ] Note hazards: utilities, intakes, docks, fragile banks, public access pinch points.
- [ ] If you suspect muck: probe soft-layer thickness at 5–10 hotspots (marked stick works).
- [ ] Write one sentence: “Success looks like ______.”

## Day-one expectations (so nobody is surprised)

What we typically do on day one:

- confirm access and staging layout,
- validate the work sequence,
- establish a “clean rhythm” for moving material to shore,
- and tune the plan so production stays consistent the rest of the deployment.

If you want a job that feels calm and controlled, the goal is to eliminate improvisation early.

## Ready to schedule?

- If your project is dredging-forward: start with [lake dredging](/lake-dredging).
- If vegetation is the constraint: start with [harvesting](/harvesting).
- If you want the fastest scoping call: [book a deployment](/#contact-form).
