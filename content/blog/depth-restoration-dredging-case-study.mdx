The lake looked “green” from a distance, but the real problem showed up during wind events: the water would turn cloudy and stay that way. Depth had been lost over time, and soft sediments were resuspending with every disturbance.

The goal wasn’t perfection in a week. The goal was **restore depth in the zones that mattered** so maintenance could stay light.

## The problem: shallow water and constant resuspension

We saw three repeating drivers:

- A fine-sediment inlet corner that kept filling
- A protected cove that stayed stagnant
- A shallow shelf where vegetation spread aggressively

## Survey & targets: what we removed and why

We set depth targets by zone and staged the work order so the shore crew could keep up with dewatering and hauling. If you out-produce your dewatering area, the job slows and handling touches explode.

We also aligned the project with baseline monitoring. Pairing dredging decisions with [water quality testing](/resources/water-quality-testing) helps you track the trend, not just the visuals.

## Production plan: dewatering discipline was the difference

The biggest operational risk was “too much wet material” too quickly.

We kept the shoreline clean by:

- Inspecting soft spots each morning (banks change fast)
- Keeping wet staging separate from truck loading
- Ending each shift with shaped piles and open access for the next day

## Results: deeper water where it mattered

Depth was restored in targeted zones and the “stirred-up” look after wind events reduced. The shoreline also became easier to maintain because the shallow shelf was broken up.

The takeaway: dredging doesn’t need to be everywhere — it needs to be strategic.
