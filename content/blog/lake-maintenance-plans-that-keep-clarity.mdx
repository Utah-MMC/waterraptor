Most water bodies don’t fail overnight — they drift. A little more vegetation each month, a little more sediment at the inlet, a little more algae after storms. By the time it’s “a problem,” you’re paying for a big intervention instead of a few smaller, predictable visits.

The fix is a maintenance cadence: **inspect, measure, remove what’s accumulating, and keep access open** so bigger work is planned instead of reactive.

## Why maintenance beats emergency cleanups

Emergency work is expensive because it’s late. Maintenance is cheaper because it’s early.

The purpose of a plan isn’t to do “everything every month.” It’s to prevent the tipping point where clarity collapses.

## A seasonal calendar that’s easy to execute

- **Spring:** open lanes and remove early growth with [harvesting](/harvesting).
- **Early summer:** test and tune with [water quality testing](/resources/water-quality-testing).
- **Peak heat:** targeted response (weed mats, debris, algae pockets).
- **Fall:** prep for next year (shoreline cleanup, sediment scoping, access improvements).

## What to measure so the plan stays honest

- Visibility trend (consistent photos help)
- Vegetation coverage (where it returns first)
- Shallow shelf changes (new weed factories)

## Response playbooks (so decisions are fast)

### When a weed mat shows up

Cut and remove before it fragments and drifts. Stage biomass so it doesn’t block access.

### When a storm dumps debris

Clear inlets first so the lake can flush. Debris sitting in corners becomes nutrient load.

### When algae spikes

Prioritize safety and monitoring; don’t improvise around unknown blooms. Use the [toxic algae guide](/resources/toxic-algae-guide) to plan next steps.
