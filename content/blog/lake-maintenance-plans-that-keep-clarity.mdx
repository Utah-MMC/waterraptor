Most water bodies don’t fail overnight — they drift. A little more vegetation each month, a little more sediment at the inlet, a little more algae after storms. By the time it’s “a problem,” you’re paying for a big intervention instead of a few smaller, predictable visits.

The fix is a maintenance cadence: **inspect, measure, remove what’s accumulating, and keep access open** so bigger work is planned instead of reactive.

This guide is designed to be practical: a calendar you can execute, what to measure, and simple response playbooks so decisions are fast.

## The clarity killers (what actually makes lakes look “bad”)

Most clarity issues are one (or a combination) of these:

- **resuspension:** fine sediment and organic muck stirred by wind/traffic,
- **nutrients:** fuel for algae and aggressive vegetation,
- **biomass:** mats and shoreline growth that trap debris and slow circulation,
- **storm inputs:** debris and inflow pulses that re-seed problems.

If you’re not sure which one is driving your site, start with a baseline from [water quality testing](/resources/water-quality-testing).

## Why maintenance beats emergency cleanups

Emergency work is expensive because it’s late. Maintenance is cheaper because it’s early.

The purpose of a plan isn’t to do “everything every month.” It’s to prevent the tipping point where clarity collapses and you’re forced into crisis work.

### The three wins of a cadence

1. **Predictable costs:** fewer surprise mobilizations.
2. **Higher effectiveness:** you remove growth before it fragments and spreads.
3. **Better outcomes:** you avoid the “reset then drift” cycle.

## The seasonal calendar (a plan you can actually run)

Use this as a default template, then tailor it to your site’s use and constraints.

| Season | Primary goal | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| Spring | Reset access + visibility | Open lanes with [harvesting](/harvesting); clear inlet corners; remove early growth before it becomes mats |
| Early summer | Baseline + tune | Run [water quality testing](/resources/water-quality-testing); identify hotspots and a response threshold |
| Peak heat | Targeted response | Address mats and debris quickly; prioritize safety for algae risks (see [toxic algae guide](/resources/toxic-algae-guide)) |
| Fall | Prep next year | Shoreline cleanup; sediment hotspot scoping; access improvements; plan winter/spring scope |

If your shoreline is eroding or collapsing into the basin, integrate [shoreline restoration](/resources/shoreline-restoration) so your maintenance plan isn’t fighting a bank that keeps failing.

## What to measure (so the plan stays honest)

Good plans don’t rely on “feel.” They rely on repeatable indicators.

### The minimum viable measurement set

- **Visibility trend:** consistent photos from the same 3–5 points (same time of day is even better).
- **Vegetation coverage:** note where growth returns first (those zones become the early-season focus).
- **Inlet/corner buildup:** track where debris pins and where fine sediment accumulates.
- **Shallow shelf changes:** shelves are weed factories; expanding shelves predict future workload.

### When to upgrade measurement

If you have recurring algae events or need to justify scope, upgrade to a testing cadence:

- nutrient trend (not just one-time readings),
- oxygen considerations (especially in summer),
- algae risk screening when blooms appear.

Start here: [water quality testing](/resources/water-quality-testing).

## The decision tree: harvesting vs. dredging vs. “wait”

A lot of maintenance cost comes from doing the right action at the wrong time.

### Use harvesting when

- mats are forming,
- shorelines are closing in,
- access lanes are disappearing,
- debris is trapped in vegetation.

Service overview: [harvesting](/harvesting).

### Use dredging when

- shallow shelves are expanding,
- turbidity spikes repeatedly after wind events,
- depth is being lost in inlets/coves,
- muck is the reason vegetation keeps accelerating.

Start planning here: [sediment removal plans](/resources/sediment-removal-plans) and [lake dredging](/lake-dredging).

### Wait (or do minimal work) when

- you don’t have enough data to pick the right lever,
- the site is stable and your trend lines are clean,
- you’re in a constrained window and a larger action would be wasted.

“Waiting” is still a plan if you’re monitoring and ready to respond quickly.

## Response playbooks (so decisions are fast)

### When a weed mat shows up

Goal: remove it before it fragments and drifts.

- cut and collect (don’t leave floaters),
- stage biomass so it doesn’t block access,
- clear the lane that keeps the shoreline visible for follow-up work.

### When a storm dumps debris

Goal: restore flow-through and stop decomposition hotspots.

- clear inlets first so the basin can flush,
- remove pinned debris in corners,
- don’t let leaf/wood piles sit in the waterline (nutrient load builds fast).

### When algae spikes

Goal: prioritize safety and measurement.

- don’t improvise around unknown blooms,
- keep people/pets out if there’s any risk,
- use the [toxic algae guide](/resources/toxic-algae-guide) for the first-response steps,
- validate with [water quality testing](/resources/water-quality-testing) before deciding next actions.

## The checklist: your maintenance program in one page

- [ ] Define the “win condition” (clarity, access lanes, depth, shoreline stability).
- [ ] Pick 3–5 photo points and take baseline photos.
- [ ] Schedule a spring reset (usually harvesting-forward).
- [ ] Set a mid-season testing cadence if algae/turbidity are recurring.
- [ ] Decide response thresholds (what triggers a service call).
- [ ] Plan fall prep and sediment hotspot scoping.
