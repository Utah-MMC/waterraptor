Corridor work is different. You’re often operating next to roads, property boundaries, utilities, and multiple stakeholders who all have different priorities.

The win condition is simple: **keep flow moving and minimize disruption**.

## Corridor constraints: narrow banks and shared access

- Limited staging space means every pile and truck route matters.
- Debris tends to pin in the same corners repeatedly.
- Work windows are tight because the corridor is always “in use.”

## Work sequence: clear, stabilize, then maintain

### 1) Clear the blockage

We start where flow is restricted and clear the pinch point. This usually creates immediate hydraulic improvement.

### 2) Remove the repeat offenders

Then we target the vegetation and debris sources that recreate the blockage.

### 3) Hand off a maintenance plan

The best corridor jobs end with a simple playbook: what to watch, where it returns first, and when to call for the next pass.

If the corridor also needs deeper capacity, we scope dredging and align it with access and staging. Start with [river & canal management](/river-canal-management).
